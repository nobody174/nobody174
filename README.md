## About Me
Hi there! 👋 I'm nobody174 *(not literally)*, a 43-year-old learning enthusiast currently on a journey to educate myself in coding.  
I started out with Python through courses on Codecademy, and my current projects reflect my learning curve in this language.

Since I'm disabled and no longer able to work, coding has become my way of staying productive and mentally engaged.  
It's been a fulfilling way to spend my time, and I'm constantly exploring new possibilities like automation, IoT, and more.

Who knows what the future holds, but for now, I'm here for the love of learning!

## What I'm working on 🛠️
- Python-based projects, starting small but growing in complexity as I learn.
- Automation, IoT, and possibly game modding in the future.

## What I’ve learned so far 📚
- Python basics through Codecademy.
- Totally new to GitHub and figuring my way around – I get that this is the place to be! 😄
- Still exploring new tools and frameworks to enhance my skills.

## Fun facts about me:
- I'm not just about code – I’m a long-time gamer, mostly into RPG and FPS games.
- I'm married, have kids, and am always looking for ways to stay mentally sharp and active.
